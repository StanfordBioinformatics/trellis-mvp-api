# trellis-mvp-api
Specifications for creating APIs to interact with the Trellis Neo4j metadata store. 

## GraphQL
In line with the [GRANDstack model](https://grandstack.io/), GraphQL is the primary API query language used to interact with Trellis. The data model, including metadata properties and relationship types, is described by the GraphQL schema, stored in the __schema.graphql__ file. Be aware that this schema is under active development and subject to change.
